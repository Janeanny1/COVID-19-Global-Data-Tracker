# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

This project explores and visualizes the global impact of COVID-19 using the [Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The analysis focuses on trends in cases, deaths, vaccinations, and correlations between key health metrics across selected countries.

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with time-series plots
- Country comparisons for total deaths and vaccinations
- Correlation heatmap of key numerical features
- Vaccination progress breakdown with pie charts
- Global choropleth map of COVID-19 cases
- Final insights and summary

## 📌 Tools & Libraries

- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Plotly Express** – Interactive map
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For organizing code and insights

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Line plots of total cases and deaths over time
- Bar chart of top 10 countries by death count
- Vaccination progress across countries
- Pie charts comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated
- Choropleth map of global case distribution

## 🔍 Insights

- The USA, Brazil, and India have the highest COVID-19 death counts.
- European countries like France and Germany lead in vaccination rates.
- Vaccination rates in African countries are significantly lower.
- Strong correlation observed between total cases and total deaths.
- Case surges without corresponding death increases may indicate improved healthcare response.
